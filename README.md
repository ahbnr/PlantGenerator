# Procedural plant generator

This project aims for the procedural generation of plant like structures using Lindenmayer systems.
It's based on the paper ["On genetic algorithms and Lindenmayer systems"](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=On%20genetic%20algorithms%20and%20Lindenmayer%20systems) by G. Ochoa.

At the moment, the project is still in an experimental stage and does not contain much documentation.
